<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Ater graduating college at East Carolina University, I began work in the utility wholesale industry. I have been in this industry for 18 years and have became a successful estimator. I have worked on countless projects, collaborating with engineers, inspectors, contractors, and manufacturers. When I first started working with blue prints, I discovered my love for solving puzzles and building things. I later discovered software developing and immediately knew that I wanted to make software engineering my profession.</p>
<br>
<p>As a student at Thinkful, I have started on my journey to becoming a software developer, and I could not be more excited! </p>
<br>
<p>If you are looking to hire a new developer, please reach out to me. I am excited for the opportunity to work with other developers on projects!</p>
