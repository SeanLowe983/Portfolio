<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Ater graduating from East Carolina University, I began work in the utility wholesale industry. 
I had a very successful career in this industry for 18 years as an estimator. During my time as an estimator,
I collaborated with engineers, inspectors, contractors, and manufacturers on countless projects. 
When I first started working with blueprints on estimation projects, I discovered my love for solving 
puzzles and building things. Later, I discovered web development and immediately knew that I 
wanted to make software engineering my profession.</p>
<br>
<p>As a student at Thinkful, I have started on my journey to become a software developer, and I could not be more excited! </p>
<br>
<p>If you are looking to hire a new developer, please reach out to me. I am excited for the opportunity to work with other developers to create masterpieces!</p>
